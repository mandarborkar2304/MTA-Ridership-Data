# MTA Daily Ridership Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes daily ridership trends for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) using Power BI. The dataset includes ridership statistics across subways, buses, railroads, and other transit services, providing insights into commuting patterns, post-pandemic recovery, and peak usage trends.

## Features
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Visualizes ridership trends across different transit services.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies fluctuations in daily ridership and long-term patterns.
- **Pre-Pandemic vs. Post-Pandemic Comparisons**: Highlights recovery trends across various transit systems.
- **Operational Insights**: Helps understand peak ridership times and service demand variations.

## Dataset
- **Source**: MTA Daily Ridership dataset
- **Time Period**: Data available from March 1, 2020, onwards
- **Coverage**:
  - New York City Subways and Buses
  - Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)
  - Metro-North Railroad (MNR)
  - Access-A-Ride (AAR)
  - Bridges and Tunnels Traffic Data

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel / SQL** (optional): For pre-processing and data cleaning.

## How to Use
1. Open the Power BI report (`.pbix` file) in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore various visualizations and filters to analyze ridership trends.
3. Modify and customize insights based on your needs.

## Insights & Findings
- **Ridership Decline & Recovery**: Significant drops in early 2020 followed by gradual recovery.
- **Peak Travel Hours**: Morning and evening commute hours show the highest ridership.
- **Mode-Specific Trends**: Subways and buses exhibit different recovery rates compared to commuter railroads.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time data updates.
- Perform predictive modeling for future ridership estimates.
- Add geospatial analysis for station-level insights.
